## What reprex provide
Describe your issue very briefly here. Then show it with a minimal, self-contained example in the following R chunk.

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2
x + y
```

Inline code is working? `r x+1`
Plot will be automatically uploaded to imgur. Don't know whether it is good or bad thing?

```{r plot} 
plot(density(rnorm(1000, 0, 2)))
```
